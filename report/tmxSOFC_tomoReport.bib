abstract = {Analysis of tomographic datasets at synchrotron light sources (including X-ray transmission tomography, X-ray fluorescence microscopy and X-ray diffraction tomography) is becoming progressively more challenging due to the increasing data acquisition rates that new technologies in X-ray sources and detectors enable. The next generation of synchrotron facilities that are currently under design or construction throughout the world will provide diffraction-limited X-ray sources and are expected to boost the current data rates by several orders of magnitude, stressing the need for the development and integration of efficient analysis tools. Here an attempt to provide a collaborative framework for the analysis of synchrotron tomographic data that has the potential to unify the effort of different facilities and beamlines performing similar tasks is described in detail. The proposed Python-based framework is open-source, platform- and data-format-independent, has multiprocessing capability and supports procedural programming that many researchers prefer. This collaborative platform could affect all major synchrotron facilities where new effort is now dedicated to developing new tools that can be deployed at the facility for real-time processing, as well as distributed to users for off-site data processing.},

abstract = {Three new algorithms for 2D translation image registration to within a small fraction of a pixel that use nonlinear optimization and matrix-multiply discrete Fourier transforms are compared. These algorithms can achieve registration with an accuracy equivalent to that of the conventional fast Fourier transform upsampling approach in a small fraction of the computation time and with greatly reduced memory requirements. Their accuracy and computation time are compared for the purpose of evaluating a translation-invariant error metric.},

abstract = {Summary We demonstrate simultaneous phase and amplitude extraction from a single defocused image of a homogeneous object. Subject to the assumptions explicitly stated in the derivation, the algorithm solves the twin-image problem of in-line holography and is capable of analysing data obtained using X-ray microscopy, electron microscopy, neutron microscopy or visible-light microscopy, especially as they relate to defocus and point projection methods. Our simple, robust, non-iterative and computationally efficient method is applied to data obtained using an X-ray phase contrast ultramicroscope.},
